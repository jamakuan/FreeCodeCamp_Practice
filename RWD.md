# box-sizing
- `box-sizing` is used to set this behavior. By default, the `content-box` model is used. With this model , when an element has a specific width, that width is calculated based only on the element's content. Padding the border values get added to the total width, so the element grows to accommodate these values.

# flex-direction
Flexbox has a main and cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, which has four possible values:

row (default): horizontal axis with flex items from left to right
row-reverse: horizontal axis with flex items from right to left
column: vertical axis with flex items from top to bottom
column-reverse: vertical axis with flex items from bottom to top
Note: The axes and directions will be different depending on the text direction. The values shown are for a left-to-right text direction.
